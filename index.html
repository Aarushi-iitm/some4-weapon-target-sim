  <h1>🎯 Math Warrior: A Discrete Math Showdown for Smart Air Defense</h1>
  <p>
    Imagine a high-stakes defense scenario: enemy drones, missiles, and combat aircraft are rapidly approaching. You have a limited arsenal—three powerful weapons—but each is only partially effective against different targets. What’s your move?
  </p>
  <p>
    This blog explores the power of <strong>discrete mathematics</strong> in tactical decision-making. Can human intuition outmatch a mathematical model in neutralizing threats?
  </p>

  <h2>🛰️ Real-World Inspiration: Smart Defense in Action</h2>
  <p>
    In modern warfare, it’s not just firepower — it’s how you use it. 
    Consider India’s strategic response during a recent escalation along the western border. 
    While drones and missiles approached key locations, India’s defense forces didn’t rely solely on their most powerful asset — the Russian S-400 system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, they adopted an <strong>integrated defense strategy</strong>. The S-400 was used as a <em>detection and tracking radar</em> — not to fire, but to spot and relay. 
    Once a threat was locked, lighter, faster-response weapons like <code>Akash</code> and <code>SPYDER</code> were activated for neutralization. 
    It wasn’t just about saving ammo — it was about deploying the <em>right weapon for the right threat</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Contrast this with the same S-400 in the Russia-Ukraine war. Used as a standalone system, its effectiveness was limited against small, agile drones. Ukraine’s tactics even involved launching attacks from within Russian territory, making detection harder and responses slower.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    ⚔️ <strong>Smart defense isn’t just about owning big weapons — it’s about <em>when</em>, <em>how</em>, and <em>why</em> you use them.</strong>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Think of it this way: You can slice a watermelon with a sword, but try pulling out a thorn with it — and you’re doomed. That’s where <strong>strategy, coordination, and math</strong> step in.
  </p>

  <h2 id="problem">🚀 Problem Setup</h2>
  <p>We consider three types of <strong>weapons</strong> and <strong>aerial targets</strong>:</p>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>UAV (Drone)</th>
      <th>Missile</th>
      <th>Combat Aircraft</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Missile</td>
      <td>0.8</td>
      <td>0.6</td>
      <td>0.3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Laser</td>
      <td>0.4</td>
      <td>0.3</td>
      <td>0.9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>EMP</td>
      <td>0.9</td>
      <td>0.2</td>
      <td>0.2</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p><strong>🔒 Constraints:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each weapon can be used only once</li>
    <li>Each target can be engaged only once</li>
    <li>Some weapons are ineffective against certain targets</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="manual">🎮 Manual Mode: Human Intuition</h2>
  <p>You play the game by selecting which weapon to assign to each threat.</p>
  <p><strong>🔍 Example:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>EMP → UAV</li>
    <li>Missile → Missile</li>
    <li>Laser → Combat Aircraft</li>
  </ul>

    📌 <strong>Pigeonhole Principle in Action:</strong><br>

    <h3>🧩 Constraint Satisfaction</h3>
    <p class="summary">Weapons must be assigned to targets without breaking rules — cooldowns, incompatibilities, or duplicates.</p>
    <button class="expand-button" onclick="toggleCard('csp-details')">⬇ Show More</button>
    <div id="csp-details" class="card-details" style="display: none;">
      <p>
        This scenario is modeled like a logic puzzle: we’re given a set of variables (weapons), domains (possible targets), and constraints:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cooldown</strong>: A weapon may not be reused in the next turn if it's on cooldown.</li>
        <li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Some weapons cannot target specific threats (e.g., EMP vs. missile).</li>
        <li><strong>One-to-One Assignments</strong>: A target cannot be hit by more than one weapon simultaneously.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This setup is similar to Sudoku, map coloring, or course scheduling — all of which fall under CSPs.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        ❗ CSPs are generally NP-complete, but efficient solutions exist for small cases or structured constraints.

    <h3>🕸️ Bipartite Graph Matching</h3>
    <p class="summary">Visualize weapons and targets as two groups of nodes — connections show effectiveness. We seek the best pairing.</p>
    <button class="expand-button" onclick="toggleCard('graph-details')">⬇ Show More</button>
    <div id="graph-details" class="card-details" style="display: none;">
      <p>
        Our problem can be represented as a <strong>bipartite graph</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Left set: Weapons</li>
        <li>Right set: Targets</li>
        <li>Edges: Probabilistic effectiveness between weapon and target</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal is to choose a <strong>maximum weight matching</strong> — a set of non-overlapping edges with the highest total value.
      </p>
      <p>
        This model naturally avoids violating "one weapon, one target" rules.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        🎯 Matching problems are well-studied in graph theory and solvable in polynomial time using algorithms like Hungarian Method.

    <h3>🎲 Probability Theory</h3>
    <p class="summary">Instead of certainty, we deal with success probabilities. We aim to maximize total expected success.</p>

    <div id="prob-details" class="card-details" style="display: none;">
      <p>
        Each edge (weapon-target pair) is weighted by a probability value between 0 and 1, indicating likelihood of neutralization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objective function is:
        <code>maximize ∑∑ (x_ij × P_ij)</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        The model doesn’t chase perfect hits — it calculates the <em>expected number of threats neutralized</em>.
      </p>

    <h3>📦 Pigeonhole Principle</h3>
    <p class="summary">More incoming threats than available weapons? Some targets will definitely slip through.</p>

    <div id="php-details" class="card-details" style="display: none;">
      <p>
        The Pigeonhole Principle is deceptively simple: if you try to assign <strong>more items</strong> than there are containers, at least one container will have more than one item.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our context:
        <ul>
          <li>Weapons = Containers</li>
          <li>Threats = Items</li>
        </ul>
        If threats > weapons, some threats will remain unengaged no matter what.

  <h2 id="model">🤖 Mathematical Mode: Optimization Strategy</h2>
  <p>We define the problem using discrete math:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Let <code>x_ij = 1</code> if weapon <code>i</code> is assigned to target <code>j</code>, otherwise 0</li>
    <li>Let <code>P_ij</code> be the success probability</li>
    <li><strong>Maximize</strong> total expected success: ∑∑ <code>P_ij * x_ij</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>🔧 Subject to:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each weapon assigned to at most one target</li>
    <li>Each target assigned to at most one weapon</li>
